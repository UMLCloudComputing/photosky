### Android Application Testing

1. **Emulator Testing**:
   Test your app on various Android emulators:
   - Different API levels (e.g., API 28, 29, 30)
   - Various screen sizes and densities

2. **Physical Device Testing**:
   Test on real Android devices if possible, as they can sometimes behave differently from emulators. Test on:
   - Different manufacturers (e.g., Samsung, Google, Xiaomi)
   - Various Android versions

3. **Functionality Testing**:
   Ensure all features work correctly on Android:
   - Image gallery display
   - Image upload from gallery
   - Camera capture and upload
   - Image deletion
   - Theme switching

4. **Performance Testing**:
   Check the app's performance on Android:
   - Load times for image gallery
   - Smoothness of scrolling
   - Camera launch and capture speed
   - Overall app responsiveness

5. **Offline Behavior**:
   Test how the app behaves when there's no internet connection:
   - Appropriate error messages
   - Graceful degradation of features
