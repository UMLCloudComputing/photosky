# üìò About PhotoSky

PhotoSky is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to:
- Upload images to an AWS S3 bucket
- View images in a responsive gallery
- Download images
- View image previews
- Access the application on both web and mobile platforms

By following this tutorial, you'll gain hands-on experience with:
- AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, S3)
- Serverless architecture
- React frontend development
- Material-UI for responsive design
- Capacitor for cross-platform mobile development
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK

## üé• Demo
