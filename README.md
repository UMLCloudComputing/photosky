## üìò About PhotoSky

Welcome to PhotoSky! PhotoSky is a mini-project activity developed by the UML Cloud Computing Club. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of AWS services to create a serverless application. PhotoSky is a simple cross-platform application that allows users to upload images to an S3 bucket and view them in a gallery. The application also allows users to download the images and view previews.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/photosky
   cd photosky
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - Install Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   
   - Install Node.js dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd photosky
     npm install
     ```

   - Create npm build directory:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     cd ..
     ```

3. **Running the web application:**

   - Start the backend:

     ```bash
     cdk deploy
     ```

   - Start the frontend:

     ```bash
     cd photosky
     npm start
     ```

   This will start the web app frontend on `http://localhost:3000`. 

4. **Running the mobile app:**
   
   If you want to launch the Android mobile app in Android Studio, run the npx cap commands below:

   - Sync the build output to the Android project:

     ```bash
     npx cap sync
     ```

   - Launch the Android project in Android Studio:

     ```bash
     npx cap open android
     ```

   This will open the Android project in Android Studio, where you can build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
